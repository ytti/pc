# Example configuration

[main]
# Default server if none given on command line.
# Optional; if missing, will use arbitrary server entry
server = "fedora"

# Optional; if missing, will not log url history.  if set, will append url of
# successful pastes to this file, one per line, newest to the bottom. The file
# is created if not existing. Parent directories will not be created. If paste
# successful but failed to write to histfile, a warning will be printed to
# stderr and will exit with a non-zero exit code.
# Relative paths will be resolved relative to the current working directory.

# Now each "server" is a configuration stored under a certain key in the
# `servers` hashmap. The key (eg. "vpaste" in the case of "servers.vpaste") is
# what is used to select a server on the command line and the default `server`
# option. Note that this can be different to the value of the `backend` for a
# server block, and multiple server blocks can be defined using the same
# backend (eg. for different public servers or different default config).

# Must have at least one server defined in the config, otherwise the program
# will exit on error.

# What follows is an example server block for each backend and an example value
# for each possible option along with comments detailing usage. Each backend
# can have a different set of options. When defining your own config, use this
# example file as a reference, or see the output of `pc show-backend
# <backendname>`.

# Where a duration value is required, it should be formatted according to
# <https://docs.rs/humantime/1.2.0/humantime/fn.parse_duration.html>.
# Basically, values like "1month 2d 3h 30m 30s" or "5m" or "300s".
